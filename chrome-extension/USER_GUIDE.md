### Are You My Valentine?

A modern take on the classic Twenty Questions game:

Difficulty levels change the number of questions allowed:
- **Easy**: 20 questions

You can use the hint button, but it costs one question attempt.

Points are tracked locally in the extension. If you connect to the full web app, your scores will be added to the global leaderboard.
