# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

The Burble Chrome Extension is a browser add-on that brings our popular brain teaser games directly to your Chrome browser. It includes word puzzles, emoji riddles, and interactive question games that can be played during short breaks or downtime.

### Is the extension free?
Yes! The Burble Chrome Extension is completely free to install and use. There are no ads or in-app purchases.

### Does it work offline?

### How often is the extension updated?
We typically release updates monthly with new puzzles, features, and bug fixes. Chrome will automatically update the extension when new versions are available.

### What browsers are supported?
Currently, the extension is only available for Google Chrome and Chromium-based browsers (like Edge, Brave, etc.). We're considering Firefox support in the future.

## Game Features

### How many puzzles are available?
The extension includes:
- 500+ emoji puzzles across multiple categories

- Unlimited Valentine question games with AI-powered responses

### Do puzzles repeat?
Word and Valentine games generate new content each time. Emoji puzzles are drawn from a large pool, so you'll rarely see repeats unless you play extensively.

## Technical Questions

### How do I uninstall the extension?
Right-click on the Burble icon in your browser toolbar, select "Remove from Chrome," and confirm the removal.

### Does the extension collect my data?
The extension only stores game progress and settings locally on your device. No personal data is collected. See our Privacy Policy for more details.

### Why does the extension need "storage" permissions?
The storage permission is used to save your game progress, scores, and settings between browser sessions. This data stays on your local device.

### Can I use the extension on mobile?
Chrome extensions are not supported on mobile browsers. However, you can use our mobile-optimized web app at burble-app.com.

### The extension is using a lot of memory. Is this normal?
The extension should use minimal resources. If you notice high memory usage, try restarting your browser or reinstalling the extension. If the problem persists, please report it to us.

## Account and Syncing

### Do I need an account to use the extension?
No, you can use all features of the extension without an account. Creating an account on the web app is only necessary if you want to sync your progress or appear on leaderboards.

### How do I connect to my Burble web app account?
Click the "Open Full App" button in the extension, then log in to your account on the web app. The connection will be established automatically.

### What information syncs between the extension and web app?
When connected, the following information syncs:
- Game scores and progress
- Favorite puzzles
- Achievement status
- Settings and preferences

### What happens if I play offline and then connect later?
Any progress made while offline will be synced to your account the next time you connect to the web app. If there are conflicts (e.g., you solved the same puzzle on both platforms), the higher score will be kept.

### Can I reset my progress in the extension?
Yes. Right-click the Burble icon, select "Options," then click the "Reset All Data" button. This will clear all local progress but won't affect your web app account data.

## Troubleshooting

### Why is the extension showing a blank screen?
This is usually caused by a temporary loading issue. Try:
1. Refreshing the browser
2. Reopening the extension
3. Restarting Chrome
4. Reinstalling the extension if the problem persists

### Some images aren't loading. How can I fix this?
Make sure your browser has permission to show images. If you're using aggressive ad blockers or privacy tools, they might be blocking the extension's resources.

### The extension crashed. What should I do?
Chrome extensions occasionally crash due to browser issues. Close and reopen Chrome to resolve most crash issues. If crashes are frequent, please report the problem to us with details about when it happens.

### How do I report bugs or issues?
