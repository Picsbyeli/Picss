# Burble Extension Promotional Materials

This folder contains HTML templates for the Chrome Web Store promotional images.

## Instructions to Create Promotional Images

1. Open the HTML files in a browser:
   - `small-promo.html` - Small Promo Tile (440x280 pixels)
   - `marquee-promo.html` - Marquee Promo Tile (1400x560 pixels)

2. Take screenshots of each page (the pages are already sized correctly):
   - In Chrome: Right-click > "Capture Screenshot" or use the developer tools
   - In Firefox: Right-click > "Take Screenshot" 
   - Or use any screen capture tool

3. Save the screenshots with these specifications:
   - Format: 24-bit PNG or JPEG (no transparency)
   - Filenames: 
     - `small-promo.png` (440x280 pixels)
     - `marquee-promo.png` (1400x560 pixels)

4. Upload these images to the Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard when submitting your extension.

## Design Elements

The designs feature:
- Purple gradient background matching Burble's brand colors
- Clear display of game types (Emoji Guess, Valentine)
- Visual representation of the extension's functionality
- Clean, modern look appealing to the target audience (middle school students)

## Store Icon (128x128)

We've created an improved store icon featuring a brain with emoji speech bubbles, representing:
- The brain teaser/puzzle theme of the extension
- The different types of puzzles (emojis, questions, ideas)
- The "Burble" concept (the brain is "burbling" or "spitting" out puzzles)

To create the store icon:
1. Open `store-icon.html` in a browser
2. Take a screenshot of the rendered icon
3. Save as a 128x128 pixel image in PNG or JPEG format

Alternatively, use the SVG version (`store-icon.svg`) by opening it in a vector editing program like Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator, making any adjustments, and exporting as a PNG.

Feel free to modify the HTML/CSS to adjust colors, text, or layout elements as needed before taking screenshots.
