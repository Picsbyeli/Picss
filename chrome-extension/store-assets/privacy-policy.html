    <h1>Burble Extension Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Last Updated: May 12, 2025</p>

    <p>The Burble Extension is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our Chrome extension.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Game progress and scores for your personal statistics</li>
        <li>Game preferences (difficulty settings, categories selected, etc.)</li>
        <li>Basic usage data to improve the extension functionality</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To save your game progress and settings</li>
        <li>To improve the extension based on usage patterns</li>
        <li>To provide a personalized gameplay experience</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Your game data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API. We do not transmit or store your personal data on external servers except when explicitly connecting to the Burble web application for fetching puzzles or syncing data (only when you choose to do so).</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Access</h2>
    <p>We do not share your information with any third parties. All data collected is used solely for providing and improving the Burble Extension experience.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our extension is designed to be suitable for users of all ages, including children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>

    <h2>Updates to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
