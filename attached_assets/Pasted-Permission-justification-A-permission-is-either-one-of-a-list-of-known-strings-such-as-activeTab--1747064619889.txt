Permission justification
A permission is either one of a list of known strings, such as "activeTab", or a match pattern giving access to one or more hosts.
Remove any permission that is not needed to fulfill the single purpose of your extension. Requesting an unnecessary permission will result in this version being rejected.

Due to the Host Permission, your extension may require an in-depth review which will delay publishing.
